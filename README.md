# Personal-Music-Library

This is a group project for my software design class.

Designed a music library of songs, playlists and albums. Each song corresponds to a specific file path. This path determines the identity of the song and the audio format used and can never change for a given song. A song can become invalid if its underlying file disappears from the operating system. It is possible to detect and remove invalid songs from a library. A song has associated meta-data organized into key-value pairs. When describing songs, keys are called tags. There are three types of tags: expected, optional, and custom. Expected tags represent pieces of data that it would be weird not to have. These include title, time, and artist. Optional tags include common tags from a fixed set. These include BPM (beats per minute), genre, composer, etc. Custom tags is a feature that allows users to have an arbitrary key-value pair associated with a song to help classify their music. The value of tags can change during the lifetime of a song. It is possible to add or remove songs, albums, playlists in the library, the library can be backed up into a database(use a stub). It's also possible to detect duplicate songs in the library.
